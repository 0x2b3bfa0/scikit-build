Simplify building Python extensions with CMake

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: http://PyCMake.readthedocs.org.

Features
--------

* (TODO) Wraps distutils so that CMake build step occurs automatically before distutils setup
* (TODO) Passes command line options through to both CMake and distutils (tries to be smart)
* (TODO) Creates simple CMakeLists.txt files for source files that you specify, allowing you to leverage CMake's cross-platform build scripting with less effort.
